**API-First Development with Automated Mocking & TypeScript Contracts**
*Accelerating Frontend-Backend Collaboration with Azure APIM*
Presented by: Ghulam Ul Hassan Ali

**Slide 1: The API-First Gap**
**Title:** The API-First Gap: A Great Ideal, Rarely Achieved
**Bullet Points:**

* Frontend teams blocked by backend timelines
* Manual mocks are inconsistent and stale
* Data contract drift causes costly bugs
* Limited early feedback and integration testing

---

**Slide 2: Imagine a Better Way**
**Title:** What if You Could Ship UIs Before Backend Code?
**Points (with animations):**

* Dynamic, realistic mocks from API specs
* Type-safe contracts from the same source
* End-to-end CI/CD automation
* One source of truth: OpenAPI

**Slide 3: Platform Overview**
**Title:** API-First Platform: Automated, Reliable, Reproducible
**Visual Diagram:**

\[TypeScript Contracts] → \[npm Package]

**Slide 4: Architecture Breakdown**
**Title:** Multi-Stage CI/CD Pipeline
**Three-Step Flow:**

1. Terraform deploys APIs to Azure APIM
2. Node script with Prism generates mocks and configures APIM policies
3. `swagger-typescript-api` generates and publishes TS contracts

**Slide 5: Why It Matters**
**Title:** Key Benefits to Engineering Teams

| Problem          | Our Solution                    |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Frontend blocked | Parallel development            |
| Contract drift   | Auto-generated TypeScript types |
| Integration risk | Real mocks from day 1           |
| Manual updates   | CI/CD automates everything      |

**Slide 6: Project Anatomy**
**Title:** What Lives Where
**Tree Diagram:**

```
infra/               # Infra & mocks
  - main.tf
  - generate-mocks.js
sample-apis/         # OpenAPI specs
types-package/       # TS contract generator
  - generate-types.ts
```

---

**Slide 7: Dev Workflow**
**Title:** How Developers Use It

1. Add OpenAPI spec to `sample-apis/`
2. Push to main branch
3. CI/CD triggers:

   * APIM update
   * Mocks generated
   * TypeScript contracts published to npm

---

**Slide 8: Run It Locally Too**
**Title:** Easy Local Development
**Code:**

```sh
cd infra
node generate-mocks.js

cd types-package
npm run generate
npm publish
```

---

**Slide 9: Looking Ahead**
**Title:** Future Enhancements

* Mock validation against schemas
* Smart caching strategies
* More expressive TS types
* Contract testing pipelines

---

**Slide 10: Final Takeaway**
**Title:** Modern Engineering, Done Right
**Key Messages:**

* Faster feedback loops
* True contract consistency
* Reduced integration pain
* CI/CD as the enabler of API-first reality

---

**Slide 11: Call to Action**
**Title:** Adopt or Extend the Platform

* Available now internally
* Ideal for new APIs or refactors
* Let’s scale this together
